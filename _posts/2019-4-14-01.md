# Building Logical Gates with Slime Mold

## A JOURNEY IN PROGRESS   **bold**    **vet?!**


Before coming to the BioHack Academy I already had heard about Slime Mold and there capability to solve network/traveling salesman problems, like this maze.

So I was very pleased to learn that there was slime mold available at the BioHack Academy to use. However repeating something I knew was already possible would not be much interesting. So after some googling,

[Discovering Boolean Gates in Slime Mould](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02168.pdf)

[Slime mold microfluidic logical gates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260914318_Slime_mold_microfluidic_logical_gates)

[Slime mould logical gates: exploring ballistic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2301)

I discovering that there is a lot of very difficult computation possibilities with smile mold.  I decide that I would start with the fundamental building blocks, namely try to build Logical Gates and progress from there.


First I needed to get some feel for this strange behaving organism, so I started with some grow tests to see how they behave. They were grown in Petri dishes. By placing them on a starting point  (S) with 1 oat meal flake as limited food source and a big food source (F) further on.
