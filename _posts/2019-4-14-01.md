# Building Logical Gates with Slime Mold

## A JOURNEY IN PROGRESS   **bold**    **vet?!**


Before coming to the BioHack Academy I already had heard about [Slime Mold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold) and there capability to solve network/traveling salesman problems, like this maze.

There is even a professional problem solver [Slime Mold Andi](https://medium.com/@slime_mold_Andi) with its own [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/slimemoldandi)

So I was very pleased to learn that there was slime mold available at the BioHack Academy to use. However repeating something I knew was already possible would not be much interesting. So after some googling,

[Discovering Boolean Gates in Slime Mould](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02168.pdf)

[Slime mold microfluidic logical gates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260914318_Slime_mold_microfluidic_logical_gates)

[Slime mould logical gates: exploring ballistic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2301)

I discovering that there is a lot of very difficult computation possibilities with smile mold.  I decide that I would start with the fundamental building blocks, namely try to build Logical Gates and progress from there.

**Grow Test**

First I needed to get some feel for this strange behaving organism, so I started with some grow tests to see how they behave. They were grown in Petri dishes. By placing them on a starting point  (S) with 1 oat meal flake as limited food source and a big food source (F) further on.

And the grow patterns 1 week later:

**Light inhibition grow test setup**

I found in the literature that one way of inhibiting the growth of slime mold is to use light, however there was no mentioning of what kind of light. So with and Arduino and a breadboard I made a light test setup. The colours from left to right: Green, Blue, Red and White.

I placed the Slime Mold with 1 oatmeal flake in the centre of the petri dish, encouraged  with the growth in the holding Petri dish and in order to have as little light absorption without any agar, surrounded with the 4 lights and 4 food sources placed beyond the lights. The entire setup up was placed in the sterile hood.

**Light inhibition grow test results**

1 day later this was the result, NO GROWTH!

**Light inhibition grow test #2!**

So I build an identical light setup, did very thing the same, however this time with the agar!

**Light inhibition grow test #2 results**

This time there was result, the White light had inhibited the growth of the Slime Mold.
